= Nippy Text Editor =
Nippy is a Scintilla-based text editor written using PyQt. It is intended to be a cross-platform,
"improved" version of Notepad++ with the features I like, without some annoyances I hate and/or
don't use, and with some additional new features never before seen in other packages.
